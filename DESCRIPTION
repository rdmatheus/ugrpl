Description: Tools for estimation and diagnostic analysis in the unit gamma regression model with
    parametric link functions. It provides a modeling scenario for rates and proportions
    (or bounded data), assuming that the dependent variable follows a unit gamma distribution. The
    differential of this implementation lies in the fact that the mean and the dispersion parameters
    can be related to their respective explanatory variables through a parametric link function.
