#' Percent Body Fat of Little Brown Bats from Aeolus Cave
#'
#' This dataset contains information on the percent body fat of little brown bats (\emph{Myotis lucifugus})
#'     sampled in Aeolus Cave, East Dorset, Vermont, located in the northeastern United States.

#' @format A data frame with 159 rows and 4 variables:

#'   \item{sex}{sex of the sampled bat, with \code{F} for female and \code{M} for male.}
#'   \item{percentfat}{percent body fat.}
#'   \item{year}{year the bat was sampled.}
#'   \item{days}{hibernation time, defined as the number of days since the fall equinox.}
#' }

#' @details
#' This subset of data was collected by Cheng et al. (2019) specifically from Aeolus Cave, one of
#'     five regions studied in the United States. The dataset provides insight into the fat stores
#'     of bats, which is crucial for understanding their persistence in the face of white-nose syndrome.
